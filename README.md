# latex-devcontainer

This is a template for writing term papers using a DevContainer.

With just Docker and VSCode, you can edit without installing TexLive locally.

## Usage

1. Click "Use This Template" at the top right to clone this repository to your account.
2. Install the `Dev Container` extension in VSCode.
3. Open the repository in VSCode, then click the `> <` icon at the bottom left and select `Reopen in Container`.
4. Edit and save `main.tex` to automatically generate `main.pdf`.
5. For references, use BibTeX and add them to `cites.bib`. Place images in the `img` directory and link them from `main.tex` as needed.
